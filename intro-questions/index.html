        <p>4. I want to lean how do make a website.</p>
        <p>5. I expect designing on screen to be a lot more frustrating.</p>
        <p>6. https://homecult.com.ua/ I think this website has effective design becasue it is simple and clean while facinating the user. The design also enhances the product. </p>
        <p>7. https://designedbywomen.org/ This website clearly expresses its goals through beautiful design. Everything from the type to the imagery creates a powerful statement.</p>
        <p>8. https://www.town.shimane-misato.lg.jp/misatoto/ I think this website does a really great job of telling the story of Misato Town as well as the rebranding. I think the scroll navigation and the style of animation really captivates the user.</p>
